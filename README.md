# week_two
This repository contains the work for my second week of the theClubhou.se Bootcamp.

#This is the wireframe for my biography page.
### This week's goal is to develop a one page bio about a class mate.

# Progress 
This is my current progress. I am trying to make the bio page appear more material than microsoft power pointy style. So far it has been really hard to try to get a theme. It kind of looks like a microsoft word document.
