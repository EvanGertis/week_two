# week_two
This repository contains the work for my second week of the theClubhou.se Bootcamp.

#This is the wireframe for my biography page.
### This week's goal is to develop a one page bio about a class mate.

# Progress 
This is my current progress. I am trying to make the bio page appear more material than microsoft power pointy style. So far it has been really hard to try to get a theme. It kind of looks like a microsoft word document.

# Final Results
I refactored all of my main content. I came up with a scheme that uses lists of components. I used a card component, list-item component, and title compoent. Now the site is very responsive. Elements fall ontop of one another when the viewport size changes.
